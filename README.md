# Gesture-control

Hand gestures is the powerful communication medium
for Human Computer Interaction (HCI).Several input
devices are available for interaction with computer, such as
keyboard, mouse, joystick and touch screen, but these
devices does not provide easier way to communicate. In this,
the system which is proposed will consists of desktop and
laptop interface, hand gesture can be used by the users need
to wear data gloves also can use the web camera or separate
cameras for recording the hand gestures.

The first and most important step toward any hand
gesture recognition system is to implement hand tracking
system. Some Sensor devices are generally used in DataGlove based methods for digitizing hand and finger motions
into multi parametric data. Other sensors used in this system
will collect hand configuration and hand movements. The
Vision Based method requires a web camera, so that one can
realize natural interaction between humans and computer
without using any other devices.
The challenging part in these systems is background
images or videos which is recorded or captured during
taking the inputs i.e. hand gesture by the user, also sometime
lightning effect the quality of the input taken which creates
the problem in recognizing the gestures. Process to find a
connected region within the image with some of the
property such as color ,intensity and a relationship between
pixels i.e. pattern is termed as segmentation. And have used
some important packages which have OpenCv-python,
tensorflow, numpy, mediapipe, imutils, scipy, numpy.

A. OPEN CV
Open CV is a library of python which tackle PC vision
issue. It is used to detect the face which is done using the
machine learning .It is a very important library and is used
in several projects to detect the face and recognize the
several frames also it supports several programming
languages. It also performs object detection and motion
detection. It also support several type of operating system
and can be used to detect the face of the animals also.

B. NUMPY
NumPy is the module of the Python. The numpy word
basically shows Numerical Python and it is utilized. This is
the module which is basically written in c language and is
said as expansion module . Numpy guarantee remarkable
execution speed. Numpy is mostly used for performing
calculations, tasks using certain functions it provides like
multiply, divide, power etc.


C. IMAGE FILTERING -HISTOGRAM
Histogram is a type of graph which represents the
movement of the pixels power in the portrayal.In this we use
to filter the images using histogram and convert them into
the rgb in order to process the image in our system .
Consequently the power of a pixel is in the range [0,255].


D. MEDIAPIPE
MediaPipe is a module for processing video, audio and
several types of related data across platform like Android,
iOS, web, edge device and several applied ML pipeline.
Several types of functions are performed with the help of
this module , we have used this module in our project to
recognize the hand gesture and detect the input from it.
 Face Detection
 Multi-hand Tracking
 Segmentation
 Object Detection and Tracking

CONCLUSION
This project is presenting a program that allows the
user to perform hand gesture for convenient and easier way
to control the software .A gesture based volume controller
doesn’t require some specific type of markers and these can
be operated in our real life on simple Personal Computers
with a very low cost cameras as this not requires very high
definition cameras to detect or record the hand gestures.
Specifically, system tracks the tip positions of the counters
and index finger of each hand.The main motive of this type
of system is basically to automate the things in our system in
order to make the things become easier to control. So in
order to make it realiable we have used this system to make
the system easier to control with the help of these
applications
